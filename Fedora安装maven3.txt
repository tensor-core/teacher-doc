Step 1 – Prerequsities
Java development kit is the primary requirement of Apache Maven. So you need to install Java development kit (JDK) on your system. Make sure you have installed JDK, not JRE.

java -version 

java version "11.0.2" 2019-01-15 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9-LTS, mixed mode)
If you don’t have Java Development Kit installed on your system. Visit Install Java 11 on CentOS/RHEL 7/6 and Fedora

Step 2 – Install Apache Maven
After verifying java version on your system. Download Apache Maven from its official website or use the following command to download Apache Maven 3.6.2.

cd /opt
wget https://www-eu.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.6.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.2-bin.tar.gz
Now extract downloaded archive using following command.

sudo tar xzf apache-maven-3.6.2-bin.tar.gz
sudo ln -s apache-maven-3.6.2 maven
Step 3 – Setup Environment Variables
As you have downloaded precompiled Apache Maven files on your system. Now set the environments variables by creating new file /etc/profile.d/maven.sh.

sudo vi /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
and add the following content.

export M2_HOME=/opt/maven
export PATH=${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
Now load the environment variables in current shell using following command.

source /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
Step 4 – Check Maven Version
Apache Maven has been successfully configured on your system. Use the following command to check the version of installed Maven on your system.

mvn -version
